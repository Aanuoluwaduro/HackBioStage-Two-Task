**Identification of somatic and germline variants from tumor and normal sample pairs - Reproduced by Aanuoluwa Adekoya (Team Crick)**

Mutation, an alteration in the arrangement of nucleic acid sequence of an organism's genome, leads to the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form. These mutations can be germline, somatic, or loss of heterozygosity (LOH). For germline mutation, the variant occurs in the sperm or egg cell and is passed directly from a parent to an embryo (child) at the time of conception. The variant is copied into every cell as the embryo divides and develops. Somatic mutation is acquired after birth, and the variants are not found in every cell in the body. For LOH, one normal copy of a gene or group of genes is lost. If pathogenic or occurring in essential genes, these mutations can lead to the onset of many diseases such as cancer (mutation in tumor suppression genes). The identification of variants helps in disease diagnosis and treatment. For germline variations, comparing the sample sequence to the reference genome sequence provides information about the variants present. However, for somatic variations, extra work is required. Cancer cells, for example, have more genetic changes than normal cells, and it is individual-specific as these changes continue to occur through the cancer developmental phase. For this reason, the identification of somatic variants requires that normal and diseased tissue is obtained from the same patient. The sequences from these can then be compared to the reference genome. 

This stage required us to reproduce a workflow that identifies germline and somatic variants and variants affected by LOH using both healthy and tumor tissue.
